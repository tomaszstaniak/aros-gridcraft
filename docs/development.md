# Building GridCraft for AROS

The pinned source is GridCraft main at version 0.19.1 (a commit, not a release tag), with the
patch series in `patches/gridcraft/`. It builds the editor (`GridCraft`) and the command line
(`gridcraft-cli`, including the MCP server over stdio).

Targets, named as `<system>-<arch>-<abi>-<platform>`:

| Target | System |
|---|---|
| `aros-x86_64-abiv11-pc` | ABIv11 distributions (AROS One), x86_64 PC |
| `aros-x86_64-abiv1-pc` | mainline AROS, x86_64 PC |
| `aros-aarch64-abiv1-raspi` | native AROS on Raspberry Pi, AArch64 |

A binary built for one target does not run on another. Each target has its own toolchain,
SDK, Cargo home (`deps/<target>/`) and build directory (`build/<target>/`). This document
describes how to build; it does not record build or test results for any target.

The build, packaging and update tools are shared by the Craft ports and live in egui-aros under
`tools/craft`. `scripts/craft.py` runs the snapshot of them that `scripts/tooling.json` pins (a
commit and the content hash of that directory), prepared in the ignored `build/tooling/`; it
takes the commit from the egui-aros checkout named in the local file, or from the URL in
`tooling.json` when there is none. The app's names are in `scripts/port.json` (environment
prefix `GRIDCRAFT`; packages `gridcraft-aros` for `GridCraft` and `gridcraft-cli`). The tools'
README describes the pin, how to change it, and `update-check`, which tries the patch series on a
newer upstream commit without changing this repository.

## What you need

- Python 3.11 or later, Git, rustup.
- Rust nightly `nightly-2026-09-01` (it reports `rustc 1.100.0-nightly (0dfb098f3 2026-08-31)`)
  with `rust-src`, and one private toolchain alias per target whose sysroot holds the AROS
  standard library source for that target, made with the rust-aros std patch tooling.
- Per target, an AROS C toolchain and the SDK it was made for. The C glue, the pthread objects
  and the Rust link must all use the same SDK: ABIv1 and ABIv11 pass `SysBase` differently, and
  a mismatch crashes inside the first system call instead of failing to build.
  - ABIv11: x86_64 AROS GCC 10.5 and the ABIv11 SDK, plus a deadwood2/AROS checkout that
    contains commit `5376f09bc1ed0c36a12fbb096406013f8a046e89` (its `compiler/pthread` is
    rebuilt with `patches/aros-pthread`).
  - mainline ABIv1: x86_64 AROS GCC 10.5 and the mainline Developer SDK.
  - Raspberry Pi: the AROS-patched Clang 20.1 for `aarch64-unknown-aros` with compiler-rt, the
    Raspberry Pi Developer SDK (its `libpthread.a` is used unchanged: `"pthread": "sdk"` in the
    local file), and a pomaros-hosted checkout at
    `3bc9359d439f9fb5655cf48924413ffe670931cc` (the C bridge of the AArch64 standard
    library). The shared tools build that bridge with their own `aros-glue` patch.
- The rust-aros files the build uses (target template, profiles, `libc-aros`, the std
  patches) at the commit in the local file (`rust_aros_commit`): a checkout of
  [rust-aros](https://github.com/tomaszstaniak/rust-aros).
- An egui-aros checkout containing the commit pinned in `upstreams.json` (branch `egui-0.37`),
  with its upstream sources prepared by its own `python3 scripts/ea.py fetch`.

## Configuration

Copy `local.example.json` (an ABIv11 example) to one ignored local file per target and fill in
the paths: `local.json` (ABIv11, the default), for example `local.v1.json` and
`local.raspi.json` for the others, each with its `"target"`. Select a file with
`GRIDCRAFT_LOCAL`:

```
GRIDCRAFT_LOCAL=local.v1.json python3 scripts/craft.py config
```

`craft.py config` shows where every setting comes from; environment variables `GRIDCRAFT_*`
override the file. Missing paths are reported, never guessed.

For the Raspberry Pi target, `aros_gcc` is the `aarch64-aros-clang` driver (with `aros_ar` and
`aros_strip` beside it), `pomaros_hosted` the pomaros-hosted checkout and `pthread` is `sdk`.
The mainline x86_64 target needs no `aros_src`.

## Steps

1. Fetch the pinned upstreams and create the work copy:

   ```
   python3 scripts/craft.py fetch
   python3 scripts/craft.py materialize
   python3 scripts/craft.py verify
   ```

2. Fetch the locked dependencies into the target's private Cargo home (once per target):

   ```
   GRIDCRAFT_LOCAL=<file> python3 scripts/craft.py deps
   ```

3. Build both programs for a target:

   ```
   python3 scripts/craft.py build
   GRIDCRAFT_LOCAL=local.v1.json python3 scripts/craft.py build
   GRIDCRAFT_LOCAL=local.raspi.json python3 scripts/craft.py build
   ```

   Add `--online` if Cargo still has to download crates. Each build goes to a new
   `build/<target>/out/<date>-<id>/` with the unstripped binaries, `build.log`,
   `cargo-messages.jsonl` and `manifest.json`. The manifest records the work copy commit, the
   patch series, compiler and SDK hashes, the command, every linked package and the binary
   hashes, and checks that no symbol is left undefined. `--worktree` builds uncommitted files
   too and is recorded as such; such builds cannot be packaged. A build is not a runtime test.

   The build passes `release` from `packaging/release.json` to the programs as
   `GRIDCRAFT_RELEASE`; `--version` and the log banner print it. Ambient `RUSTFLAGS`,
   `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and similar overrides are refused. `GRIDCRAFT_PANIC` selects the panic
   strategy instead of the target's default.

   What the build adds around the pinned source: `patches/crates/` (the shared set named in
   `crates.json`, checked against the Cargo.lock checksums and the recorded patched-tree
   hashes), the shared tools' `libc-aros` and `aros-glue` patches, `patches/aros-pthread/` (ABIv11 only) and the panic profile
   of the target. The window, input and renderer layer comes from egui-aros, prepared by its
   own `ea.py vendor`.

4. Package a build. `scripts/package.py` forwards to `craft.py package`:

   ```
   export APKG_PACK=/path/to/arospkg/tools/apkg-pack
   python3 scripts/package.py binary build/<target>/out/<id>
   python3 scripts/package.py source build/<target>/out/<id> [build/<target>/out/<id> ...]
   ```

   The tools write `dist/GridCraft-<release>[-rN]-<target>.zip` and
   `dist/GridCraft-<release>[-rN]-source.zip` and add them to `dist/SHA256SUMS`. They refuse
   a dirty repository, a build from a dirty work copy, binaries that differ from the manifest
   and undefined symbols. A binary archive also needs a catalogue description per target in
   `packaging/catalogue/`, whose `requires_system` must match the C runtime libraries the
   programs open at start; this repository does not have those descriptions yet. The programs
   are stripped with `strip --strip-unneeded --remove-section .comment` only: a full strip
   removes relocations AROS applies when it loads a program. The program icon is generated from
   GridCraft's 64x64 application icon with the stack and ToolTypes from `release.json`
   (stack 16 MiB, `GUI_RENDERER=CPU`).

5. Check an archive on the host: unpack it into a new directory, compare the programs with the
   hashes recorded in the package and run the target's `nm -u` on them (it must print
   nothing). Then test the unpacked package on the target system itself.

## The spreadsheet on AROS

`apps/gridcraft-aros` replaces the desktop app's eframe/wgpu window with egui-aros: an
Intuition window on the default public screen. The renderer is chosen at run time with
`--gui-renderer CPU|AUTO|GPU` or the `GUI_RENDERER` ToolType. The program runs in the -nix
path mode: requesters speak DOS names and the program converts them. Open, Save As and Insert
Picture use ASL requesters with the desktop app's filters and save types. The system clipboard
carries text and pictures. Settings and `GridCraft.log` live in `GridCraftData` in the
program's drawer (or `GRIDCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR`). A start-up entry
raises the program's stack to 16 MiB. `gridcraft-cli` runs its command on a thread with its
own stack.

Not available on AROS, and reported as such: printing, HTML on the clipboard, the localhost
control server (`--control` is refused), the self-updater and a native window per workbook
window.

`GridCraft --screenshot FILE.png [--screenshot-frames N]` writes the window's pixels after N
frames (20 by default) and quits. `--window WxH` sets the inner size. `--test-steps FILE.json`
drives the window through a scripted sequence. `GRIDCRAFT_LOG=file` names the log file;
`RUST_LOG=debug` raises the level. `GRIDCRAFT_TRACE_INPUT=1` logs every frame's key
and text events and the focused widget.

## Guest scripts

`tests/guest/` holds AmigaDOS scripts for one run on an ABIv11 guest, with their own README:
`run-cli` (version, information, conversions, a scripted edit saved twice, the MCP handshake
over stdio) and `run-shot` (three unattended starts with `--screenshot` in a row).
`tests/fixtures/hello.xlsx` is their input.

## Host checks

`python3 scripts/craft.py host test -p gridcraft-aros` runs the AROS program's host tests with
the pinned egui-aros.
